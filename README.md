This project demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques using a sample CSV dataset. It is designed for learning and practice purposes to understand how raw data is prepared for further analysis or machine learning models.

Dataset
Airbnb NYC Listings

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – For data manipulation

NumPy – For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization

Scikit-learn (sklearn) – For preprocessing techniques

Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Read the CSV file using pandas.read_csv().

3. Data Understanding

by cheking shape, categories, info etc.


5. Data reduction

Removed useless columns

7. Data cleaning
Handle missing values
drpo dupplicate values

8. Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize:
Distribution of features

Correlations using heatmaps

Outliers using boxplots

6. Removed Outliers

7.  Feature Engineering & Transformation

Applied encoding techniques (e.g., One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding) for categorical variables.

Applied scaling/normalization using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for numerical data.

8.  Output
Final preprocessed data is ready for use in machine learning models or analysis.

 Purpose
This project was done for learning and practice only. It helps build a strong foundation in handling real-world data before applying machine learning algorithms.
